QuestDB attempts to implement standard ANSI SQL. We also attempt to be PostgresSQL compatible, although some of it is work in progress. 
This page presents the main extensions we bring to SQL and the main differences that one might find in SQL but not in QuestDB's dialect

## SQL extensions

We have extended SQL language to support our data storage model and simplify semantics of time series queries.

#### LATEST BY
[LATEST BY](crudOperations.md) is a clause introduced to help perform UPDATE and DELETE operations within an append-only framework.

#### SAMPLE BY
[SAMPLE BY](sqlSELECT.md#sample-by) for time-based [aggregations](functionsAggregation.md) with an efficient syntax.
The short query below will return the simple average balance from a list of accounts by one month buckets.
```sql
select avg(balance) from accounts sample by 1M
```

## Important differences from standard SQL

#### `SELECT * FROM` Optionality

In QuestDB `select * from` is optional.

So `SELECT * FROM tab;` achieves the same effect as `tab;`

While `select * from` makes SQL look more complete on a single time, there are examples where its optionality makes things a lot easier to read. See examples in [GROUP BY](#absence-of-group-by) section.

#### Absence of `GROUP BY`

We do not support explicit `GROUP BY` clause. Instead, QuestDB optimiser derives group-by implementation from `SELECT` clause. 

In standard SQL, users might write a query like the below.
```sql
SELECT a, b, c, d, sum(e) FROM tab GROUP BY a, b, c, d;
```

However, enumerating subset of `SELECT` columns in the `GROUP BY` clause redundant and therefore unnecessary. 
The same SQL in QuestDB SQL-dialect will look like:

```sql
SELECT a, b, c, d, sum(e) FROM tab;
```

Let's look at another more complex example using HAVING in standard SQL.
```sql
SELECT a, b, c, d, sum(e) 
FROM tab 
GROUP BY a, b, c, d 
HAVING sum(e) > 100;
```
In QuestDB's dialect, `select * from` optionality and featherweight sub-queries come to the rescue to create a 
smaller, more readable query, without unnecessary repetitive aggregations.
```sql
(SELECT a, b, c, d, sum(e) s FROM tab) WHERE s > 100;
```
