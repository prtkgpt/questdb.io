## Overview

`UNION` is used to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` statements.
To work properly, 
- Each select statement should return the same number of column
- Each column should have the same type
- Columns should be in the same order

### UNION ALL
By default, `UNION` will return distinct results. 
`UNION ALL` will return all results including duplicates.

## Syntax
`UNION` us used as follows:

```sql
SELECT . .
UNION [ALL]
SELECT . .
```

## Examples

Let's assume the following two tables
listA
| Description   | ID                     |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Red Pen       | 1                      |
| Blue Pen      | 2                      | 
| Green Pen     | 3                      |

listB
| Description   | ID                     |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Pink Pen      | 1                      |
| Black Pen     | 2                      | 
| Green Pen     | 3                      |

```sql
liastA UNION listB
```

will return
| Description   | ID                     |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Red Pen       | 1                      |
| Blue Pen      | 2                      | 
| Green Pen     | 3                      |
| Pink Pen      | 1                      |
| Black Pen     | 2                      | 

```sql
liastA UNION ALL listB
```

will return
| Description   | ID                     |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Red Pen       | 1                      |
| Blue Pen      | 2                      | 
| Green Pen     | 3                      |
| Pink Pen      | 1                      |
| Black Pen     | 2                      | 
| Green Pen     | 3                      |
