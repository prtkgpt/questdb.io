InfluxDB line protocol is a simple and convenient way to add data points to
QuestDB. Now with
[authentication](/docs/reference/api/influxdb/#authentication), your endpoint is
more secure.

<!--truncate-->

[InfluxDB line protocol](/docs/reference/api/influxdb) is popular because it is
a simple text based format, you simply open a socket and send data points line
by line. Implementation is easy because encoding is trivial and there is no
response to parse. The protocol can be used over UDP or TCP with minimal
overhead.

This is all great as long as your endpoint can not be accessed by unauthorised
actors that could send junk to your database. If your endpoint is public, then
you could secure it by encapsulating it in a secure transport layer such as
[TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), adding complexity
to your infrastructure that needs to be managed. This is something we sought to
avoid. Our goals when implementing authentication were:

- Use a secure, future proof, authentication method.
- Minimise protocol complexity and transport overhead.
- Configuration solely in QuestDB without the need for storing secret data.

To these ends we decided to provide authentication for the InfluxDB line
protocol over TCP with a simple
[challenge/response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication)
mechanism, where the challenge is a
[nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) and the response a
signature.
[Elliptic curve cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)
(ECC curve P-256) with [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) was chosen
for the signature algorithm, this ensures strong authentication that is
hopefully future proof. The elliptic curve cryptographic keys have a public and
secret component, it is possible to configure QuestDB with just the public part,
thereby mitigating any risks of storing secret information on the server.
Languages such as
[JavaScript and Go](/docs/develop/insert-data/#influxdb-line-protocol) have
standard libraries that implement ECC, the
[JSON Web Key](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) standard can be used to
store and distribute the keys in a clear and ubiquitous manner.

The authentication challenge/response mechanism was chosen to minimise the
impact on the protocol, it works as follows:

1. When the client connects it sends its key id to the server.
2. The server responds with a
   [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) in printable
   characters.
3. The client responds with the [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)
   encoded signature of the nonce.
4. If authentication fails the server will disconnect, if not then the client
   can revert to sending standard InfluxDB line protocol data points.

We developed this form of authentication in response to users who have QuestDB
deployments where a simple form of authentication is required without the
overheads of full encryption.
